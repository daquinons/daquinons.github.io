<p>FoodieFun is a REST API to remember what and where you have eaten. You can create multiple reviews for different food items that you've eaten in any restaurant. I was in charge of building the whole backend server as a Backend Architect, delivering clear documentation and tests for the different endpoints using Jest and Supertest.</p>

Built using:
- Node.js
- Express
- Knex
- Bcrypt.js
- JsonWebToken
- SQLite3 & MySQL
- Jest & Supertest
